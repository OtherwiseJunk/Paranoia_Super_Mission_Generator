## Notes on Paranoia Super Mission Generator

The goal of this program is to reduce time necessary for a GM to prepare a mission to ~1 hour. Right now, I expect that it takes about 2 hours to generate a mission (1 hour to flesh out the details of the one-shot, and 1 hour to generate the PCs).

Development of the program can be slow, due to it being a hobbyist project (so there isn't much pressure for me to constantly update the software). While there are ways of making money from tabletop RPGs (GM gratuities, podcasting), I do not seek to explore them at this time. "Slow and steady" is better than suffering burnout.

The program is focused on generating a "table-facing document", as opposed to a "GM-facing document".

 - A "table-facing document" is one that is focused on improving gameplay on the table, and directly entertains the PCs. (Examples: The GM's cribbed notes from a professional mission.)
 - A "GM-facing document" is one that is focused on giving ideas to GMs (which is useful when GMs wants to come up with missions on their own or conduct some improv lessons) and directly entertains GMs. (Examples: The injokes and artwork of a professional mission.)

While GM-facing documents are incredibly important (and fun to read), they do not directly help someone run a game, so my main emphasis is on generating table-facing" material, such as the floaters and the extremely sparse background info.
