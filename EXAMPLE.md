**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 87-T1C, an Undersea Corridor in Sector JKG. Gretchen-G-MXK-5 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: War Hero, job type: Clerical) currently controls 87-T1C with an iron fist. Gretchen-G-MXK-5's ultimate goal is to loyally support The Computer and its High Programmers (even they have to use unapproved channels).

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 has a problem though. And that problem is Harmony-R-HGA-3 (secret society: Psion, mutant power: Hypersenses, personality: Bored Bureaucrat, job type: Emergency), who wants to erase Gretchen-G-MXK-5's clone line, and they want to do so out of envy. Harmony-R-HGA-3's ultimate goal is to cover up the fact that they're...um...dead (their identity has since been stolen by traitors from the Romantics society).

It is this conflict between Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 also has some personal possessions - Project Tersnalmu (a Jackobot) and Project Naatri (a Deluxe PDC with enhanced infrared-light camera, shoots accurately in total darkness). These possessions could be used to help defend 87-T1C from the threat of Harmony-R-HGA-3...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - Text message on PDC. The message is intact and correct.

*Mission Briefing* - Officer skims through the entire briefing as if they expects those present to know the details already, then walks out without any questions.

*Mission* - A Vulture Squadron (the Eritern) is incredibly popular on the vidshows and beloved by The Computer for their political othrodoxy. They are also super incompetent. Please complete this important mission for them, while letting them take all the credit. (Mission - A tipoff implies that Gretchen-G-MXK-5 is a high-level Psion agent with a second brain. Investigate this without alarming Gretchen-G-MXK-5's loyal supporters in Power Services. They’re twitchy.)

*Outfitting* - IR Market: A ‘Broke’ market. Troubleshooters always leave broke, with stuff that’s broke. Bad deals all around.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Cargetfi, type: Mobility enabler (skates, boots, motorized shopping cart, vehicle, jet pack, propeller helmet, frictionless shoe soles) (GM Note: Gradually mutates user)

*Complications* -
1. The effect the PCs are ordered to prevent will be caused by their actions.
2. The actual problem has been exaggerated hundreds of times over, attracting the attention of far more important and powerful agencies than it deserved.
3. Most citizens in JKG are genuinely loyal to The Computer and its regime. They will do whatever it takes to defend it against all forms of treason.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room contains nothing but miniature stools, where the PCs perch with difficulty and discomfort.

*Secret Society Missions*:

Anti-Mutant - A member of your team has mutagens and plans to mutate loyal citizens! Augh! Don’t let anyone ingest any pharmaceuticals, unless you know for a fact what the chemicals are!

Computer Phreaks - Steal Naatri from Gretchen-G-MXK-5, as payback for their crimes against our society.

Communists - Rescue Harmony-R-HGA-3 from doom at the hands of the capitalist oppressors and recruit him to our great cause!

Corpore Metal - See to it that no meatbag abuses any bots while you are around, and that Gretchen-G-MXK-5 will never abuse any bot again, ever.

Death Leopard - If you were to, like, destroy or spray-paint or decorate 87-T1C, man, that would be moderately cool.

FCCC-P - Comprehensively recon Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and build up a dossier on them.

Frankenstein Destroyers - Harmony-R-HGA-3 will be at 87-T1C. Take these tools and program a robot (Tersnalmu) to attack them. When the bot attacks, you rescue them. That should help you convert them to our cause.

Free Enterprise - Word of mouth sells! Advertise the IR market availability of (product, service, etc.) any way you can. Infect high- clearance folks with this SellFast.D virus. They’ll be your best customers; they just can’t help themselves!

Humanist - Comprehensively recon Harmony-R-HGA-3 and build up a dossier on them.

Illuminati - Acquire three compromising pictures of Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and send them to this address. Three!

Mystics - Gretchen-G-MXK-5 really needs to mellow out... permanently. Give him a hit of this drug so they can see the light, man. Oh, and have some yourself when you want.

Pro Tech - Destroy 87-T1C. All of it. Burn it all to the ground.

Psion - Comprehensively recon Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and build up a dossier on them.

PURGE - Deliver Old Reckoning atlas, dated 2097 to Harmony-R-HGA-3, as payment for 'service rendered'.

Romantics - Deliver Laser pointer to Gretchen-G-MXK-5, as payment for 'service rendered'.

Sierra Club - Destroy power generators in JKG and distribute these miniature flame generators (candles) among the citizens to teach them the pleasure of ‘roughing it.’

Spy For Another Alpha Complex - We suspect that Harmony-R-HGA-3 is an Internal Security plant spying on us. Dissuade them with extreme prejudice.

Program Group - Steal Naatri from Gretchen-G-MXK-5, as payback for their crimes against our society.


*Floaters*:

Locations
1. Building 18-GWC, Servants of Cthulhu HQ. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by INFRARED supervisor (secret society: Computer Phreaks, mutant power: Deep Thought, personality: Unlikely Academic, job type: Security).
2. Building FQ-U8I, ULTRAVIOLET-clearance enviro conditioning ducts. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by YELLOW supervisor (secret society: Illuminati (cover society: Romantics), mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Insignificant Layman, job type: Analysis).
3. Building EM-7OD, GREEN-clearance postal sorting room. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by YELLOW supervisor (secret society: Mystics, mutant power: Deep Thought, personality: Efficient Sociopath, job type: Quality Control).

Bureacracies
1. Size: Large office, room for 100 desks. Shape: Triangular. Problem: Room is in poor condition. Ceiling sags, cracks in the walls, exposed highvoltage lines, etc. Floor apt to give way at any moment. Clearance of Workers: RED and ORANGE with YELLOW Supervisor. Waiting Time: Infinitely long line. Higher-clearance personnel keep cutting in front of the Troubleshooters. Serious Bootlicking, Bribery, Intimidation or Access required to do anything but starve slowly at the end of the line.
2. Size: Real large office, room for 500 desks, multi-tiered (but where are the stairs?). Shape: Triangular. Problem: Very crowded. Hundreds of citizens are waiting in line, queued up and p’d off. Security clearances vary from INFRARED to GREEN. The line moves slowly. Citizens near the front look as if they haven’t eaten for days. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW. Waiting Time: Short line of citizens waiting; 30 minutes.
3. Size: Large office, room for 100 desks. Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Lighting malfunction. Either pitch-black darkness or blinding light. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: 10 minutes.

Excuses (Information)
1. Give obviously wrong information. ‘Repeat’ it a second time, completely differently and still obviously wrong.
2. An honest I-don’t-know.
3. The information is unavailable due to an unknown mutant force.

Equipment Denial
1. ‘Certainly, here you go.’ [The clerk provides an obviously mistaken order. Instead of the requested cone rifle, the Troubleshooters receive, say, 10 meters of twine.]
2. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
3. ‘According to [your briefing officer/my supervisor/The Computer], that equipment is not necessary for your mission.’

Clerks
1. Snob: Feels superior to any other citizen who doesn’t understand and appreciate the bureaucratic runaround as well as he does. This means just about anybody. Loves to make things difficult for poor PCs.
2. Harried: Clerk buried beneath piles of paperwork. Protruding hands snatch the form from the PCs and stamp it a dozen times with a red stamp that reads ‘Approved.’ If the PCs don’t have a form, a muffled voice inside the pile tells them to go away.
3. Cheerful and Incompetent: Like his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. But all his answers are dead wrong. Confidently and helpfully sends Troubleshooters down wrong hallway to get wrong form from wrong department.

Clues
1. Tracing the suspect’s PDC via The Computer.
2. A matchbook that belong to the suspect.
3. The most recent message on a suspect’s PDC.

Evidence
1. Assorted lengths of wire – the sort of wire you might use when wiring a detonator to a bomb!
2. A bot that’s obviously been expertly reprogrammed by a traitor to refuse to answer questions. Well, that or it’s got a defective brain module, but really, which is more likely?
3. A seditious complaint form complaining about botulism in the cafeteria.Doubting the perfection of The Computer’s food preparation and handling staff is treason.
