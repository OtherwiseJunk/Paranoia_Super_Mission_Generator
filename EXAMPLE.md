**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 39-A5I, a Museum of Famous Forms in Sector DCH. Allie-I-ZWI-2 (secret society: PURGE, mutant power: Adhesive Skin, personality: Bluff Professional, job type: Management) currently controls 39-A5I with an iron fist. Allie-I-ZWI-2's ultimate goal is to promote an extreme form of mutant supremacy - only their kind of mutants dominate, and normal humans and all other kinds of mutants subservient.

Allie-I-ZWI-2 has a problem though. And that problem is Luther-Y-SRF-1 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Passive-Aggressive Clerk, job type: Celebrity), who wants to blackmail Allie-I-ZWI-2, and they want to do so out of envy. Luther-Y-SRF-1's ultimate goal is to make their secret society more powerful.

It is this conflict between Allie-I-ZWI-2 and Luther-Y-SRF-1 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Allie-I-ZWI-2 also has some personal possessions - Project Posmentci (a Snooper (small hovering sphere that tracks a target's scent)) and Project Toranco (a Deluxe PDC with enhanced infrared-light camera, shoots accurately in total darkness). These possessions could be used to help defend 39-A5I from the threat of Luther-Y-SRF-1...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - Special ‘breaking news’ bulletin in middle of vidshow: interrupts crucial revelation. Identifies the PCs by name. The briefing location is wrong. The correct information is replaced by extortion threat from anonymous hacker - "Send 100cr to this Gray Subnet account and I'll send you the data."

*Mission Briefing* - Bureaucratic snafu assigns briefing officer to the room adjacent to the PCs; won’t join PCs for fear of violating orders; shouts at the top of their voice to be heard, or conveys briefing information by notes, courier, Morse code, etc.

*Mission* - It appears that our secret treason detector in 39-A5I was malfunctioning, and reported everyone as a Commie Mutant Traitor. We need you to investigate the citizens we terminated and find evidence justifying their termination.

*Outfitting* - IR Market: Free Enterprise member ‘Nathan D,’ operator of this IR market, is messily killed by rival FreeEnt capo in PCs’ presence.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Isparday, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Enrages citizens against user)

*Complications* -
  1. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Allie-I-ZWI-2 happily display their new armaments in DCH.
  2. A minor malfunction in 39-A5I may lead to a major problem. The PCs must fix the malfunction and deal with the problems already created.
  3. A major malfunction has rendered DCH uninhabitable; the local environment kills an unprotected citizen in minutes if not seconds.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room is fitted with seesaws, with a PC sitting on one side of each and a BLUE Trooper with blaster on the other. In the lower position, the PCs are obscured by a charred blast shield. The debriefing officer reads mission details, raising each PC on a note of treason, lowering them on a point of commendation. (This is an experimental HPD&MC psychological exercise intended to encourage loyalty.)

*Floaters*:

Locations
  1. Building 7P-XEW, RED-clearance PLC storage facility or warehouse. Aligned with Allie-I-ZWI-2, controlled by INFRARED supervisor (secret society: Frankenstein Destroyers, mutant power: Ventriloquist, personality: Unlikely Academic, job type: Emergency).
  2. Building BX-ZBC, underground society of refugee traitors, living within in the Underplex's abandoned shafts. Aligned with Luther-Y-SRF-1, controlled by RED supervisor (secret society: Illuminati (cover society: Humanist), mutant power: Mechanical Intuition, personality: Evangelist “Team Player”, job type: Creative).
  3. Building GJ-Q73, IR Marketeers' Living Quarters. Aligned with Allie-I-ZWI-2, controlled by RED supervisor (secret society: Program Group, mutant power: Mechanical Intuition, personality: Cloak-and-Dagger Schemer, job type: Clerical).

Bureacracies
  1. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: No desks. Citizens stand around. Some have a tape
              outline on the floor showing where their desk should go. Their files and papers are scattered all over their desk areas, making information retrieval rather difficult.. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW with one GREEN administrator visiting. Waiting Time: No wait, suspiciously efficient service.
  2. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Triangular. Problem: Very crowded. Hundreds of citizens are waiting in line, queued up and p’d off. Security clearances vary from INFRARED to GREEN. The line moves slowly. Citizens near the front look as if they haven’t eaten for days.. Clearance of Workers: RED and ORANGE with YELLOW Supervisor. Waiting Time: Infinitely long line. Higher-clearance personnel keep cutting in front of the Troubleshooters. Serious Bootlicking, Bribery, Intimidation or Access required to do anything but starve slowly at the end of the line.
  3. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Triangular. Problem: Not enough desks. Deskless employees stand by edges of the room and charge toward any vacated desk. Fights are frequent, fatalities not unheard of.. Clearance of Workers: None. Staffed entirely by clerkbots.. Waiting Time: 10 minutes.

Excuses (Information)
  1. The information is unavailable due to Commie sabotage.
  2. The form to request that information is currently being revised.
  3. If the NPC told the inquirer, the NPC would have to kill him. If the inquirer insists, do it and fine him 100 credits. The next clone doesn’t remember the answer, so you don’t need an actual answer.

Equipment Denial
  1. ‘I’m sorry, citizen, we appear to be temporarily all out of that item.’
  2. No one anywhere in the entirety of PLC has ever heard of the requested item, or at least doesn’t admit it.
  3. ‘That item has been sent to our labs for testing due to apparent design flaws. We may still have some in stock, though, if you want me to go check...’

Clerks
  1. Antagonistic: Argues about everything. If accused of being antagonistic, will argue about that too. Would rather die than succumb to threats of physical violence—and probably will—die, that is.
  2. Dolefully docile: Feebly laughs if Troubleshooters try to cheer him up, or gazes at them gratefully with tear-filled eyes. Breaks into spontaneous sobs. Swallows noisily. ‘I’m s-s-sorry? (Gulp)’
  3. A dreamer: This citizen doesn’t really want to work in Bureaucracy Central. This citizen wants to be a HPD&MC vidstar. Talks endlessly about ‘the big break’ and popu- lar reality vidshows. He shows around his portfolio of photographs.

Clues
  1. Minutes from a briefing in a particular location.
  2. A faithful petbot who cooperates with the investigation.
  3. The most recent message on a suspect’s PDC.

Evidence
  1. A piece of heavily chewed ConeRifle-brand BubbleGum. The collectible sticker that comes in every packet is missing.
  2. A dropped Bouncy Bubble Beverage can. The killer drank B3... good for him!
  3. A signed confession, which may or may not be an IntSec plant.
