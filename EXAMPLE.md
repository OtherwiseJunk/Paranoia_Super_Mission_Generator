**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 87-T1C, an Undersea Corridor in Sector JKG. Gretchen-G-MXK-5 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: War Hero, job type: Clerical, current status: Psychotic, Kill-Crush-Smash-Destroy Physical Threat) currently controls 87-T1C with an iron fist. Gretchen-G-MXK-5's ultimate goal is to manipulate The Computer’s local CompNode (and to hide evidence of their manipulation).

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 has a problem though. And that problem is Harmony-R-HGA-3 (secret society: Pro Tech, mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Rebellious Naysayer, job type: Analysis, current status: 'Demon'-Possessed Bureaucratic Obstacle), who wants to blackmail Gretchen-G-MXK-5, and they want to do so out of gluttony. Harmony-R-HGA-3's ultimate goal is to help expand the might of their rapidly-growing PLC firm (thereby expanding their personal power in the process).

It is this conflict between Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 also has some personal possessions - Project Gennuu (an Explodatron (small, nervous bot that exists to explode in hopeless situations, taking enemies and PCs with it)) and Project Badeni (an Aerosol paint stripper). These possessions could be used to help defend 87-T1C from the threat of Harmony-R-HGA-3...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - An INFRARED courier delivers alert verbally, seeks 10cr 'tip' for the delivery. Demeanor: truckling. The briefing location is wrong. Alert itself is damaging—text message contains software virus that crashes PDC or vidscreen, physical alert has toxins or is radioactive, etc.

*Mission Briefing* - Briefing officers undercover; wary, paranoid; speak in evasive code-phrases.

*Mission* - Fix a broken vending machine in 87-T1C. Stay alert; citizens nearby report explosions and laser fire.

*Outfitting* - IR Market: A ‘Broke’ market. Troubleshooters always leave broke, with stuff that’s broke. Bad deals all around.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Tivesetro, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Only affects imaginary targets)

*Complications* -
1. The whole incident is designed as a Loyalty Test, either for the Troubleshooters or for someone else.
2. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Gretchen-G-MXK-5 happily display their new armaments in JKG.
3. Most citizens in JKG are genuinely loyal to The Computer and its regime. They will do whatever it takes to defend it against all forms of treason.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room contains nothing but miniature stools, where the PCs perch with difficulty and discomfort.

*Secret Society Missions*:

Normal Missions -

- This rare tape preserves an Old Reckoning film that we can use in our secret society propaganda. Find a way to to copy it. Bring a dozen copies to our next meeting.

- We’ve discovered B3 is loaded with chemicals that make us subservient to [the machines/anti-machine forces/those other evil secret societies]! Don’t let anyone drink it!

- We suspect that Harmony-R-HGA-3 is an Internal Security plant spying on us. Dissuade them with extreme prejudice.

- We suspect that Gretchen-G-MXK-5 is an Internal Security plant spying on us. Dissuade them with extreme prejudice.

- Prevent your team from achieving their objective by any means necessary, but don’t allow your cover to be blown.

- Field-test this standard-issue Fake armor.

Spy Missions (to be used in case a person belongs to more than one secret society) -

- Word of mouth sells! Advertise our own IR Markets any way you can. Infect high-clearance SellFast.D virus. They’ll be your best customers; they just can’t help themselves! (GM Note: Though Free Enterprise tends to run the most profitable IR Markets, every secret society has IR Markets of their own. Sometimes these IR Markets exist solely to make money, but other times, they exist a vehicle for secret society propaganda - the Communists' Red Market and PURGE's Weapon Corridor are two such examples.)

- Field-test this standard-issue Slugthrower (with solid slug ammo).

- Steal something vital to the mission and leave this ransom note in its place. Those who fufill the ransom will later be 'recruited' to our society.

*Floaters*:

Locations
1. Building V3-ECK, Servants of Cthulhu HQ. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by YELLOW supervisor (secret society: Computer Phreaks, mutant power: Bureaucratic Intuition, personality: Efficient Sociopath, job type: Celebrity, current status: Drugged (sandallathon, visomorpain) Mental Threat).
2. Building Q2-5OT, INFRARED-clearance Hangar. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by YELLOW supervisor (secret society: PURGE, mutant power: Empathy, personality: Unlikely Academic, job type: Management, current status: Stumbling, Prone-To-Breakage, Awkward Sadistic Hinderance).
3. Building 59-93B, INFRARED-clearance Bright Vision Re-Education Center. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by INFRARED supervisor (secret society: Program Group, mutant power: Deep Thought, personality: Shameless Brown-noser, job type: Emergency, current status: Paranoid (armed with Laser pistol (W3K energy); barrel color is INDIGO and Combat suit) Information Source).

Bureacracies
1. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Wrong security-clearance room. Way too high (maybe INDIGO). Clerks are all standing outside in the corridor expecting to get terminated for low productivity. They scream and scatter when Troubleshooters arrive. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW. Waiting Time: Very long line, four hours.
2. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Lighting malfunction. Either pitch-black darkness or blinding light. Clearance of Workers: RED and ORANGE with YELLOW Supervisor. Waiting Time: No wait, suspiciously efficient service.
3. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Hexagonal. Problem: Too many desks. Way too many desks. Desks piled on top of each other. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW with one GREEN administrator visiting. Waiting Time: Very long line, four hours.

Excuses (Information)
1. If the NPC told the inquirer, the NPC would have to kill him. If the inquirer insists, do it and fine him 100 credits. The next clone doesn’t remember the answer, so you don’t need an actual answer.
2. Refer inquirer to a real room far above his clearance.
3. If the inquirer files the appropriate request form, it will be processed in 6-8 days.

Equipment Denial
1. ‘For that you need to fill out Form #B5AT67.’ [When asked for the form, say it requires another form, and so on until they give up. If it looks like they will keep going, send them off to some remote location, where they will fall into a food vat or something.]
2. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
3. ‘I’m sorry, citizen, we appear to be temporarily all out of that item.’

Clerks
1. Cheerful and competent: Likes his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. If he can’t help the Troubleshooters, he knows precisely where they should go and to whom they should talk. This should completely unnerve them.
2. Greedy: Wink at your players. Rub two fingers together as if you’re holding a coin. Say stuff like ‘Sure, I think that can be (wink, wink) arranged.’ Jingle the change in your pockets.
3. Crazy. Schizoid. Whacked-out: Seems normal at first, but, if any pressure is brought to bear, starts dancing around the room singing, ‘Can’t catch me, I’m the gin- gerbread man!’ and current loyalty songs.

Clues
1. The Troopers take a wrong turn and end up where they’re supposed to be.
2. A trail of blood.
3. A photo of an important location that the suspect liked.

Evidence
1. A piece of heavily chewed ConeRifle-brand BubbleGum. The collectible sticker that comes in every packet is missing.
2. Assorted lengths of wire – the sort of wire you might use when wiring a detonator to a bomb!
3. Someone scratched *‘down with The Computer’* into the side of this desk.
