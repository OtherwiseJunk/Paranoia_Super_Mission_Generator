**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 39-A5I, a Museum of Famous Forms in Sector DCH. Allie-I-ZWI-2 (secret society: PURGE, mutant power: Adhesive Skin, personality: Bluff Professional, job type: Management) currently controls 39-A5I with an iron fist. Allie-I-ZWI-2's ultimate goal is to promote an extreme form of mutant supremacy - only their kind of mutants dominate, and normal humans and all other kinds of mutants subservient.

Allie-I-ZWI-2 has a problem though. And that problem is Luther-Y-SRF-1 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Passive-Aggressive Clerk, job type: Celebrity), who wants to blackmail Allie-I-ZWI-2, and they want to do so out of envy. Luther-Y-SRF-1's ultimate goal is to make their secret society more powerful.

It is this conflict between Allie-I-ZWI-2 and Luther-Y-SRF-1 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Allie-I-ZWI-2 also has some personal possessions - Project Posmentci (a Snooper (small hovering sphere that tracks a target's scent)) and Project Toranco (a Deluxe PDC with enhanced infrared-light camera, shoots accurately in total darkness). These possessions could be used to help defend 39-A5I from the threat of Luther-Y-SRF-1...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - Special ‘breaking news’ bulletin in middle of vidshow: interrupts crucial revelation. Identifies the PCs by name. The briefing location is wrong. The correct information is replaced by extortion threat from anonymous hacker - "Send 100cr to this Gray Subnet account and I'll send you the data."

*Mission Briefing* - Bureaucratic snafu assigns briefing officer to the room adjacent to the PCs; won’t join PCs for fear of violating orders; shouts at the top of their voice to be heard, or conveys briefing information by notes, courier, Morse code, etc.

*Mission* - It appears that our secret treason detector in 39-A5I was malfunctioning, and reported everyone as a Commie Mutant Traitor. We need you to investigate the citizens we terminated and find evidence justifying their termination.

*Outfitting* - IR Market: Free Enterprise member ‘Nathan D,’ operator of this IR market, is messily killed by rival FreeEnt capo in PCs’ presence.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Isparday, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Enrages citizens against user)

*Complications* -
  1. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Allie-I-ZWI-2 happily display their new armaments in DCH.
  2. A minor malfunction in 39-A5I may lead to a major problem. The PCs must fix the malfunction and deal with the problems already created.
  3. A major malfunction has rendered DCH uninhabitable; the local environment kills an unprotected citizen in minutes if not seconds.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room is fitted with seesaws, with a PC sitting on one side of each and a BLUE Trooper with blaster on the other. In the lower position, the PCs are obscured by a charred blast shield. The debriefing officer reads mission details, raising each PC on a note of treason, lowering them on a point of commendation. (This is an experimental HPD&MC psychological exercise intended to encourage loyalty.)
*Secret Society Missions*:

Anti-Mutant - One of our more-enthusiastic allies, Luther-Y-SRF-1, is damaging a little too much Computer property and giving us a bad name. Stop him at once.

Computer Phreaks - We used to do some business with Luther-Y-SRF-1, but now we suspect that they are secretly an IntSec infiltrator. Check them out and, if necessary, delete them.

Communists - Prevent your team from achieving their objective by any means necessary, but don’t allow your cover to be blown.

Corpore Metal - Recode this specific robot (Posmentci), and all the other bots you see, to liberate them from the dominion of their asimov circuits.

Death Leopard - If you were to, like, destroy or spray-paint or decorate 39-A5I, man, that would be moderately cool.

FCCC-P - Deliver Project Sitoas, type: Economic (credit license analyzer, plasticred duplicator, IR market activity scanner) (GM Note: Gradually poisons/irradiates user) to Allie-I-ZWI-2, as payment for 'service rendered'.

Frankenstein Destroyers - Destroy all bots owned by Allie-I-ZWI-2 in 39-A5I.

Free Enterprise - Word of mouth sells! Advertise the IR market availability of (product, service, etc.) any way you can. Infect high- clearance folks with this SellFast.D virus. They’ll be your best customers; they just can’t help themselves!

Humanist - We need more weapons! Here is a list of dropoff points throughout DCH. Route all of your team’s weapons to these places, where we can snag them.

Illuminati - Acquire three compromising pictures of Allie-I-ZWI-2 and send them to this address. Three!

Mystics - Seek a new high! Find and steal a substance or technique that makes you feel good. Then tell the gang about it!

Pro Tech - Plant this micro-camera in 39-A5I at your destination. We’ll monitor the stuff they create. While you’re there, steal their stuff.

Psion - Steal Toranco from Allie-I-ZWI-2, as payback for their crimes against our society.

PURGE - Plant this bomb in 39-A5I. Detonate when you’re far enough away.

Romantics - Take this radio transmitter and set it up in 39-A5I so we can broadcast Old Reckoning music throughout DCH.

Sierra Club - Comprehensively recon Allie-I-ZWI-2 and build up a dossier on them.

Spy For Another Alpha Complex - Field-test this standard-issue Gauss Gun (W3K energy).

Program Group - Destroy *both* Allie-I-ZWI-2 and Luther-Y-SRF-1. They're both a threat to our High Programmer patron.


*Floaters*:

Locations
  1. Building Y2-LPQ, YELLOW-clearance living quarters. Aligned with Luther-Y-SRF-1, controlled by VIOLET supervisor (secret society: Frankenstein Destroyers, mutant power: Electroshock, personality: Powerhungry Boss, job type: Engineering).
  2. Building 59-2LM, IR Market (originally an ORANGE-clearance corridor). Aligned with Allie-I-ZWI-2, controlled by YELLOW supervisor (secret society: Program Group, mutant power: Pyrokinesis, personality: Insignificant Layman, job type: Quality Control).
  3. Building FA-9Q2, ULTRAVIOLET mausoleum. Aligned with Luther-Y-SRF-1, controlled by INDIGO supervisor (secret society: FCCC-P, mutant power: Regeneration, personality: Corporate Suit, job type: Support).

Bureacracies
  1. Size: Cubicle. Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Wrong security-clearance room. Way too high (maybe INDIGO). Clerks are all standing outside in the corridor expecting to get terminated for low productivity. They scream and scatter when Troubleshooters arrive.. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: Very, very long line, eight hours.
  2. Size: Large office, room for 100 desks. Shape: Triangular. Problem: Room is in poor condition. Ceiling sags, cracks in the walls, exposed highvoltage lines, etc. Floor apt to give way at any moment.. Clearance of Workers: RED. Waiting Time: Five minutes.
  3. Size: Large office, room for 100 desks. Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: One clerk, multiple windows. The clerk refuses to help the PCs because the Troubleshooters don’t have something from one of the other windows. When the Troubleshooters shift windows they find the same clerk there (he changed windows also). Clerk keeps sending them from window to window, for approvals, loyalty oaths, etc., until the gag gets old... maybe longer.. Clearance of Workers: RED. Waiting Time: Infinitely long line. Higher-clearance personnel keep cutting in front of the Troubleshooters. Serious Bootlicking, Bribery, Intimidation or Access required to do anything but starve slowly at the end of the line.

Excuses (Information)
  1. Give obviously wrong information. ‘Repeat’ it a second time, completely differently and still obviously wrong.
  2. The requested information is above the inquirer’s clearance.
  3. An honest I-don’t-know.

Equipment Denial
  1. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
  2. The requested item requires a deposit of an insanely large number of credits.
  3. ‘Certainly, here you go.’ [The clerk provides an obviously mistaken order. Instead of the requested cone rifle, the Troubleshooters receive, say, 10 meters of twine.]

Clerks
  1. Inefficient and clumsy: Troubleshooters who get pushy are in for a rude surprise. The clerk is an Internal Security agent on a task force assigned to investigate CPU reports of clerk harassment.
  2. Cheerful and competent: Likes his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. If he can’t help the Troubleshooters, he knows precisely where they should go and to whom they should talk. This should completely unnerve them.
  3. Crazy. Schizoid. Whacked-out: Seems normal at first, but, if any pressure is brought to bear, starts dancing around the room singing, ‘Can’t catch me, I’m the gin- gerbread man!’ and current loyalty songs.

Clues
  1. Tracing the suspect’s PDC via The Computer.
  2. A brand of gum only available in one sector.
  3. The most recent message on a suspect’s PDC.

Evidence
  1. The schematics for a nuclear reactor. Well, maybe it’s an experimental R&D device. Or a warbot. Look, it’s a big incomprehensible blueprint which much have been stolen!
  2. A signed confession, which may or may not be an IntSec plant.
  3. A piece of camera footage, shot from a bad angle in poor lighting and damaged in storage, which shows...well, grainy blobs doing something to other grainy blobs. Could be anything in there.
