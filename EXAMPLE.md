**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 87-T1C, an Undersea Corridor in Sector JKG. Gretchen-G-MXK-5 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: War Hero, job type: Clerical, current status: Psychotic, Kill-Crush-Smash-Destroy Physical Threat) currently controls 87-T1C with an iron fist. Gretchen-G-MXK-5's ultimate goal is to manipulate The Computer’s local CompNode (and to hide evidence of their manipulation).

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 has a problem though. And that problem is Harmony-R-HGA-3 (secret society: Pro Tech, mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Rebellious Naysayer, job type: Analysis, current status: 'Demon'-Possessed Bureaucratic Obstacle). Harmony-R-HGA-3's ultimate goal is to help expand the might of their rapidly-growing CPU firm (thereby expanding their personal power in the process).

Harmony-R-HGA-3 is a key supporter of Project Trigennu (an attempt to decrease the number of traitors in JKG)...however this project is quickly running of resources. To ensure that the project can be successfully completed, Harmony-R-HGA-3 wants to take over 87-T1C so they can use its resources. Gretchen-G-MXK-5, however, is resisting Harmony-R-HGA-3's schemes, as they do not want to lose their resources to support such a dubious endeavour.

It is this conflict between Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 also has some personal possessions - Project Uketba (a scrubot) and Project Niisac (a Large-denomination plasticred). These possessions could be used to help defend 87-T1C from the threat of Harmony-R-HGA-3...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - An INFRARED courier delivers alert verbally, seeks 10cr 'tip' for the delivery. Demeanor: sullen, rude, suicidal. The briefing time is wrong. The correct information is in machine-readable code, missing vowels, encrypted, etc. Computer Phreaks can help. The Computer doesn't see the problem.

*Mission Briefing* - After going through various improbable security and distraction systems, the Troubleshooters meet their briefing officer, who pretends to be a robotic time traveller from the future.

*Mission* - Water and fertilize a hydroponic garden secretly located in 87-T1C, using this new chemical.

*Outfitting* - IR Market: Red Market, run by Commies. They only barter or trade evenly. PCs who own little more than their own overalls must buy items elsewhere, then come back here to trade for similarly priced items. (You could make them trade for the shirts off their backs.)

*R&D Equipment* - Project Potiveset, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Only affects imaginary targets)

*Complications* -
1. The whole incident is designed as a Loyalty Test, either for the Troubleshooters or for someone else.
2. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Gretchen-G-MXK-5 happily display their new armaments in JKG.
3. Most citizens in JKG are genuinely loyal to The Computer and its regime. They will do whatever it takes to defend it against all forms of treason.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room contains nothing but miniature stools, where the PCs perch with difficulty and discomfort.

*Secret Society Missions*:

Normal Missions -

- Plant this bomb in 87-T1C. Detonate when you’re far enough away.
- Our secret society currently controls 87-T1C. We receive intel that another secret society may seek to destroy or subvert it - don't let that happen!

- Prevent your team from achieving their objective by any means necessary, but don’t allow your cover to be blown.
- Our rivals are trying to make your mission fail. Do whatever you can to make sure it succeeds.

- Destroy 87-T1C. All of it. Burn it all to the ground.
- In 87-T1C, hook this little kit into the power grid. It diverts electricity to our Underplex base for a new project. If you see anything cool there, steal it. Make sure the building stays intact, so we can better drain power from it.

Spy Missions (to be used in case a person belongs to more than one secret society) -

- We used to do some business with Harmony-R-HGA-3, but now suspect they are secretly an IntSec infiltrator. Check them out and, if necessary, terminate them.
- Covertly help Harmony-R-HGA-3, a shell-shocked veteran who had previous dealings with us, regain his confidence and loyalty.

- Harmony-R-HGA-3 was a *former* officer in our secret society. Take away their hard-earned medals as a punishment for betraying our society. Note that you may have to kill them to take away their medals.
- Comprehensively recon Harmony-R-HGA-3 and build up a dossier on them. Keep Harmony-R-HGA-3 alive while building up the dossier.

Alternative Missions (to be used in case the normal missions are too boring and predictable) -

- We control access to a very addictive drug. Distribute this addictive drug among your team and anyone you meet so that we can later subvert them for our purposes. Yeah, okay maybe it has some terrible side-effects, but what a high! (GM Note: Terrible side-effects could include turning someone into a murdering psychopath, mutating users, or just killing them outright. Anti-Mutants won't *intentionally* hand out mutagens.)
- Always need some more drugs to help our recruits accomplish secret society missions! Get a supply and drop it at our cache at 87-T1C. (GM Note: The type of drugs the secret society wants depend on the type of society and the needs of the mission. Here's some example drugs. Computer Phreaks: Wakey-Wakey and other anti-sleep drugs. Psion:  mutagens. Anti-Mutants: anti-mutagens. PURGE: combat drugs. Mystics: actually, any drug will do.)
- We need more weapons! Here is a list of dropoff points throughout JKG. Route all of your team’s weapons to these places, where we can snag them.


*Floaters*:

Locations
1. Building VY-CKR, VIOLET-clearance Vulture Squadron battle readiness exercise field. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by INFRARED supervisor (secret society: Mystics, mutant power: Deep Thought, personality: Evangelist “Team Player”, job type: Security, current status: Meticulous, Obsessive-Compulsive Sadistic Hinderance).
2. Building HE-GBG, ULTRAVIOLET mausoleum. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by INDIGO supervisor (secret society: Humanist, mutant power: Electroshock, personality: Recalled Veteran, job type: Celebrity, current status: Meticulous, Obsessive-Compulsive Information Source).
3. Building OD-OR9, Cory-G-FOX-6 (elite Troubleshooter) Memorial Briefing Room. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by INDIGO supervisor (secret society: PURGE, mutant power: Electroshock, personality: Unlikely Academic, job type: Creative, current status: 'Demon'-Possessed Mental Threat).

Bureacracies
1. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Circular. Clerks stand behind a circular counter in the center of the room, surrounded by citizens seeking service. Clerks feel besieged. Problem: Secret society stronghold controlled by Mystics. They have a prop to indicate their loyalty (Sierra Club might have a hanging fern, Romantics might have fuzzy dice and Pink Floyd records, etc.) Any threatening remarks about the prop would cause every clerk to draw their lasers and start blasting. Service here is 'fast and efficient' compared to the more legal offices. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW. Waiting Time: Short line of citizens waiting; 30 minutes.
2. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Triangular. Problem: Too many desks. Way too many desks. Desks piled on top of each other. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: No wait, suspiciously efficient service.
3. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Hexagonal. Problem: Too many desks. Way too many desks. Desks piled on top of each other. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW with one GREEN administrator visiting. Waiting Time: Very long line, four hours.

Excuses (Information)
1. If the NPC told the inquirer, the NPC would have to kill him. If the inquirer insists, do it and fine him 100 credits. The next clone doesn’t remember the answer, so you don’t need an actual answer.
2. Refer inquirer to a real room far above his clearance.
3. If the inquirer files the appropriate request form, it will be processed in 6-8 days.

Equipment Denial
1. ‘For that you need to fill out Form #B5AT67.’ [When asked for the form, say it requires another form, and so on until they give up. If it looks like they will keep going, send them off to some remote location, where they will fall into a food vat or something.]
2. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
3. ‘I’m sorry, citizen, we appear to be temporarily all out of that item.’

Clerks
1. Cheerful and competent: Likes his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. If he can’t help the Troubleshooters, he knows precisely where they should go and to whom they should talk. This should completely unnerve them.
2. Greedy: Wink at your players. Rub two fingers together as if you’re holding a coin. Say stuff like ‘Sure, I think that can be (wink, wink) arranged.’ Jingle the change in your pockets.
3. Crazy. Schizoid. Whacked-out: Seems normal at first, but, if any pressure is brought to bear, starts dancing around the room singing, ‘Can’t catch me, I’m the gin- gerbread man!’ and current loyalty songs.

Clues
1. The Troubleshooters take a wrong turn and end up where they’re supposed to be.
2. A trail of blood.
3. A photo of an important location that the suspect liked.

Evidence
1. A piece of heavily chewed ConeRifle-brand BubbleGum. The collectible sticker that comes in every packet is missing.
2. Assorted lengths of wire – the sort of wire you might use when wiring a detonator to a bomb!
3. Someone scratched *‘down with The Computer’* into the side of this desk.

Rumors (Are they true? What is Truth™ anyway?)
1. All bots in JKG are actually remote-controlled by The Computer. They only have simulated individual personalities but not all of them actually know this.
2. My friend’s workmate’s boss’s printer repairman’s clone told him that 90% of the cameras in this sector are dummies.
3. They’re banning travel between sectors todaycycle, except for Troubleshooters on missions. I wonder why.
