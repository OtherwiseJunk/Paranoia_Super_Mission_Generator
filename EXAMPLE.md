**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 87-T1C, an Undersea Corridor in Sector JKG. Gretchen-G-MXK-5 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: War Hero, job type: Clerical, current status: Psychotic, Kill-Crush-Smash-Destroy Physical Threat) currently controls 87-T1C with an iron fist. Gretchen-G-MXK-5's ultimate goal is to manipulate The Computer’s local CompNode (and to hide evidence of their manipulation).

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 has a problem though. And that problem is Harmony-R-HGA-3 (secret society: Pro Tech, mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Rebellious Naysayer, job type: Analysis, current status: 'Demon'-Possessed Bureaucratic Obstacle), who wants to blackmail Gretchen-G-MXK-5, and they want to do so out of gluttony. Harmony-R-HGA-3's ultimate goal is to help expand the might of their rapidly-growing PLC firm (thereby expanding their personal power in the process).

It is this conflict between Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 also has some personal possessions - Project Gennuu (an Explodatron (small, nervous bot that exists to explode in hopeless situations, taking enemies and PCs with it)) and Project Badeni (an Aerosol paint stripper). These possessions could be used to help defend 87-T1C from the threat of Harmony-R-HGA-3...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - An INFRARED courier delivers alert verbally, seeks 10cr 'tip' for the delivery. Demeanor: truckling. The briefing location is wrong. Alert itself is damaging—text message contains software virus that crashes PDC or vidscreen, physical alert has toxins or is radioactive, etc.

*Mission Briefing* - Briefing officers undercover; wary, paranoid; speak in evasive code-phrases.

*Mission* - Fix a broken vending machine in 87-T1C. Stay alert; citizens nearby report explosions and laser fire.

*Outfitting* - IR Market: A ‘Broke’ market. Troubleshooters always leave broke, with stuff that’s broke. Bad deals all around.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Tivesetro, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Only affects imaginary targets)

*Complications* -
1. The whole incident is designed as a Loyalty Test, either for the Troubleshooters or for someone else.
2. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Gretchen-G-MXK-5 happily display their new armaments in JKG.
3. Most citizens in JKG are genuinely loyal to The Computer and its regime. They will do whatever it takes to defend it against all forms of treason.

*Mission Debriefing* - Room contains nothing but miniature stools, where the PCs perch with difficulty and discomfort.

*Secret Society Missions*:

Normal Missions -

- The Team Hygiene Officer belongs to a rival secret society and is attempting to subvert the rest of the team. Prevent them from doing their job so that we can we can make sure that we don't have to fight *even* more enemies. (GM Note: Sierra Club also wants to interfere with the Hygiene Officer because they want the player's teammates to rediscover the joys of getting ‘down and dirty.’)

- Acquire three compromising pictures of Harmony-R-HGA-3 and send them to this address. Three!

- Covertly help Harmony-R-HGA-3, a shell-shocked veteran who had previous dealings with us, regain his confidence and loyalty.

- A certain isolated off-net terminal in 87-T1C has some cool data. Copy it and bring it back.

- Destroy *both* Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3. They're both a threat to our secret society.

- Carry Blackmail material on Harmony-R-HGA-3 and sell it for the best price. We'll give you a commission.

Spy Missions -

- This object (Rolodex with Old Reckoning names) contains a datajack with a cool new trojan. Plug it into any confession booth at 87-T1C to run it. (GM Note: If the player is part of the Computer Phreaks, then the player's society built the datajack themselves. Otherwise, the player's secret society bought (or stole) it from the Phreaks and now want to use to steal data.)

- Steal something vital to the mission and leave this ransom note in its place. Those who fufill the ransom will later be 'recruited' to our society.

- Openly pretend to be sworn enemies of Frankenstein Destroyers so as to lure them out.

*Floaters*:

Locations
1. Building IQ-OVR, BLUE-clearance transtube shaft. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by ULTRAVIOLET supervisor (secret society: Communist, mutant power: Matter Eater, personality: Great Compromiser, job type: Engineering, current status: Drugged (sandallathon, visomorpain) Information Source).
2. Building 4M-RAJ, CompNode. Aligned with Gretchen-G-MXK-5, controlled by ULTRAVIOLET supervisor (secret society: Humanist, mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: Dismal Enigma, job type: Celebrity, current status: Stumbling, Prone-To-Breakage, Awkward Mental Threat).
3. Building 8I-BAP, secure dome access gate. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by GREEN supervisor (secret society: Illuminati (cover society: Humanist), mutant power: Adhesive Skin, personality: Charismatic Leader, job type: Support, current status: Wild-eyed, Frenized, Incoherent Sadistic Hinderance).

Bureacracies
1. Size: Real, real large office. Think the Astrodome with a low ceiling. Citizens at the far end look incredibly small. Shape: Triangular. Problem: Not enough desks. Deskless employees stand by edges of the room and charge toward any vacated desk. Fights are frequent, fatalities not unheard of. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: Infinitely long line. Higher-clearance personnel keep cutting in front of the Troubleshooters. Serious Bootlicking, Bribery, Intimidation or Access required to do anything but starve slowly at the end of the line.
2. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Difficult accessway. Housing Preservation and Development has decided to save credits by making the Troubleshooters stoop, crawl or even slither along on their bellies to reach the clerks inside. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW with one GREEN administrator visiting. Waiting Time: Very, very long line, eight hours.
3. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Wrong security-clearance room. Way too high (maybe INDIGO). Clerks are all standing outside in the corridor expecting to get terminated for low productivity. They scream and scatter when Troubleshooters arrive. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: Very long line, four hours.

Excuses (Information)
1. Imply the question is a sign of unhappiness.
2. Give information as a printout, entirely blacked out except for pronouns and articles.
3. If the NPC told the inquirer, the NPC would have to kill him. If the inquirer insists, do it and fine him 100 credits. The next clone doesn’t remember the answer, so you don’t need an actual answer.

Equipment Denial
1. ‘I’m sorry, citizen, we appear to be temporarily all out of that item.’
2. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
3. ‘For that you need to fill out Form #B5AT67.’ [When asked for the form, say it requires another form, and so on until they give up. If it looks like they will keep going, send them off to some remote location, where they will fall into a food vat or something.]

Clerks
1. Fun-loving citizen: Doesn't take their job at all seriously. Take their goal of having fun *way* too seriously.
2. Dadist: Speaks only in broken sentence fragments. Stream-of-consciousness. Probable psychopath. Warrants investigation. Behind you.
3. Cheerful and competent: Likes his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. If he can’t help the Troubleshooters, he knows precisely where they should go and to whom they should talk. This should completely unnerve them.

Clues
1. A brand of gum only available in one sector.
2. A witness cooperates with the PCs but only really can provide directions on where the PCs should go next.
3. The Troopers take a wrong turn and end up where they’re supposed to be.

Evidence
1. A cryptic note. Cryptic, in that the characters can’t even read the language it’s written in. Maybe it’s a code, maybe it’s crazed scribblings.
2. A rambling anonymous message posted on a Grey Subnet, accusing an unnamed person of being a traitor/ mutant/cockroach in disguise/mean.
3. A piece of heavily chewed ConeRifle-brand BubbleGum. The collectible sticker that comes in every packet is missing.
