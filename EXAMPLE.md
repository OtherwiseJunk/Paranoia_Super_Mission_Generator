        **Trust The Computer!**

        *Background* - The mission will take place in 39-A5I, a Museum of Famous Forms in Sector DCH. Allie-I-ZWI-2 (secret society: PURGE, mutant power: Adhesive Skin, personality: Bluff Professional, job type: Management) currently controls 39-A5I with an iron fist. Allie-I-ZWI-2's ultimate goal is to promote an extreme form of mutant supremacy - only their kind of mutants dominate, and normal humans and all other kinds of mutants subservient.

        Allie-I-ZWI-2 has a problem though. And that problem is Luther-Y-SRF-1 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Passive-Aggressive Clerk, job type: Celebrity), who wants to blackmail Allie-I-ZWI-2, and they want to do so out of envy. Luther-Y-SRF-1's ultimate goal is to make their secret society more powerful.

        It is this conflict between Allie-I-ZWI-2 and Luther-Y-SRF-1 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

        Allie-I-ZWI-2 also has some personal possessions - Project Posmentci (a Snooper (small hovering sphere that tracks a target's scent)) and Project Toranco (a Deluxe PDC with enhanced infrared-light camera, shoots accurately in total darkness). These possessions could be used to help defend 39-A5I from the threat of Luther-Y-SRF-1...but could also prove to be a danger.

        *Mission Alert* - Special ‘breaking news’ bulletin in middle of vidshow: interrupts crucial revelation. Identifies the PCs by name. The briefing location is wrong. The correct information is replaced by extortion threat from anonymous hacker - "Send 100cr to this Gray Subnet account and I'll send you the data."

        *Mission Briefing* - Bureaucratic snafu assigns briefing officer to the room adjacent to the PCs; won’t join PCs for fear of violating orders; shouts at the top of their voice to be heard, or conveys briefing information by notes, courier, Morse code, etc.

        *Mission* - Guard 39-A5I from Death Leopard trying to subvert the building. Be careful not to subvert the building yourself.

        *Outfitting* - IR Market: Free Enterprise member ‘Nathan D,’ operator of this IR market, is messily killed by rival FreeEnt capo in PCs’ presence.

        *R&D Equipment* - Project Isparday, type: Behavior modifier (hypnosis devices, pheromone emitters, subsonic/supersonic irritants) (GM Note: Enrages citizens against user)

        *Complications* -
          1. Surplus Armed Forces weaponry floods the IR market. Supporters of Allie-I-ZWI-2 happily display their new armaments in DCH.
          2. This mission is being recorded live by HPD&MC as part of a vidshow. The cameraperson may be a part of the PC's team as well.
          3. A minor malfunction in 39-A5I may lead to a major problem. The PCs must fix the malfunction and deal with the problems already created.

        *Mission Debriefing* - A cavernous spherical reactor coolant chamber (recently decommisioned) with the PCs securely strapped into dentist chairs at wrist, ankle, waist and chin. The booming voice of the unseen officer echoes from strategically placed speakers.
