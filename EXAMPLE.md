**Trust The Computer!**

*Background* - The mission will take place in 87-T1C, an Undersea Corridor in Sector JKG. Gretchen-G-MXK-5 (secret society: "Spy For Another Alpha Complex", mutant power: Toxic Metabolism, personality: War Hero, job type: Clerical, current status: Psychotic, Kill-Crush-Smash-Destroy Physical Threat) currently controls 87-T1C with an iron fist. Gretchen-G-MXK-5's ultimate goal is to manipulate The Computer’s local CompNode (and to hide evidence of their manipulation).

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 has a problem though. And that problem is Harmony-R-HGA-3 (secret society: Pro Tech, mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Rebellious Naysayer, job type: Analysis, current status: 'Demon'-Possessed Bureaucratic Obstacle). Harmony-R-HGA-3's ultimate goal is to help expand the might of their rapidly-growing CPU firm (thereby expanding their personal power in the process).

87-T1C is a key cornerstone in Project Trigennu (an attempt to decrease the number of traitors in JKG) - and both Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 were assigned to work on this project. The project was a complete success, and The Computer plans on rolling it out across the rest of the complex. However, Gretchen-G-MXK-5 stole all the credit for working on this successful project, causing Harmony-R-HGA-3 to feel jealous. They now seek revenge (goal: overthrow Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and take 87-T1C for themselves out of greed).

It is this conflict between Gretchen-G-MXK-5 and Harmony-R-HGA-3 that the Troubleshooters must deal with if they are to complete the mission successfully.

Gretchen-G-MXK-5 also has some personal possessions - Project Badeni (a Combot) and Project Actiesmer (an Old Reckoning atlas, dated 2097). These possessions could be used to help defend 87-T1C from the threat of Harmony-R-HGA-3...but could also prove to be a danger.

*Mission Alert* - Text message on PDC. The message is intact and correct.

*Mission Briefing* - Briefing officer is dead on arrival and no one comes to replace him. May have notes on their body that describe the PCs’ mission.

*Mission* - Erase all evidence proving the Fimainern Incident ever happened in JKG. You know nothing about the Incident? Good, keep it that way. (GM Note: The Incident was the result of a failed Troubleshooting mission - mission: A Troubleshooter team has gone rogue and is currently conducting an unauthorized Troubleshooting mission (mission: A Troubleshooter team has gone rogue and is currently conducting an unauthorized Troubleshooting mission (mission: Commie mutant traitors have threatened to disrupt the televised Loyal Celebration parade. Patrol the route at 87-T1C and stop them.). Stop this mission from succeeding.). Stop this mission from succeeding.)

*Outfitting* - PLC: A PLC shop that has none of the equipment the PCs need, but is willing to make strange and incorrect substitutions.

*R&D Equipment* - Project Enermu, type: Communications, unusual type (telepathy gun, telephone that attaches miles-long wire to body of recipient, holographic mime projector, tight-beam loudspeaker) (GM Note: Enrages citizens against user)

*Complications* -
1. The Commie Mutant Traitors are winning - the PCs must take steps to either adapt to the new order or to stop it.
2. JKG is covered with graffiti and society tags (indictating that the sector's Loyalty index is at an all-time low).
3. Harmony-R-HGA-3's secret society is openly intervening in the crisis by sending military troops.

*Mission Debriefing* - The debriefing officer is dead on arrival, seated at an empty desk in a plain room, and no one arrives to replace him.

*Secret Society Missions*:

Normal Missions -

- Administer this potent mutagen to other members of your team. It will give them a mutant power. Then recruit them into our society. (GM Note: Psion wants to give other people mutagens to further mutant dominance. Other secret socieites just want to build an Unstoppable Mutant Army. Anti-Mutants *will* not issue this type of mission, period. It's a betrayal of their core ideology! If you really want to use this secret society mission though, have Anti-Mutants hand out a R&D device that imitiates a semi-useful mutant power.)

- Gretchen-G-MXK-5 was once a member of our society but has since created their own splinter faction. Discredit or kill the splitter.

- In 87-T1C, hook this little kit into the power grid. It diverts electricity to our Underplex base for a new project. If you see anything cool there, steal it.

- Covertly help Gretchen-G-MXK-5, a shell-shocked veteran who had previous dealings with us, regain his confidence and loyalty.

- Plant this bomb in 87-T1C. Detonate when you’re far enough away.

- This rare tape preserves an Old Reckoning film that we can use in our secret society propaganda. Find a way to to copy it. Bring a dozen copies to our next meeting.

Spy Missions (to be used in case a person belongs to more than one secret society) -

- We’ve discovered B3 is loaded with chemicals that make us subservient to [the machines/anti-machine forces/those other evil secret societies]! Don’t let anyone drink it!

- We suspect that Harmony-R-HGA-3 is an Internal Security plant spying on us. Dissuade them with extreme prejudice.

- We suspect that Gretchen-G-MXK-5 is an Internal Security plant spying on us. Dissuade them with extreme prejudice.

*Floaters*:

Locations
1. Building QP-47V, cone rifle fuse packing facility. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by INDIGO supervisor (secret society: Frankenstein Destroyers, mutant power: Rubbery Bones, personality: Recalled Veteran, job type: Creative, current status: Wild-eyed, Frenized, Incoherent Mental Threat).
2. Building GL-5QH, INFRARED-clearance CPU waiting room. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by INFRARED supervisor (secret society: Psion, mutant power: Adrenalin Control, personality: Ideological Crusader, job type: Celebrity, current status: Drugged (thymoglandin, hydropsionic acid) Information Source).
3. Building HI-ODO, INFRARED-clearance living quarters. Aligned with Harmony-R-HGA-3, controlled by RED supervisor (secret society: Corpore Metal, mutant power: Adhesive Skin, personality: Powerhungry Boss, job type: Security, current status: Meticulous, Obsessive-Compulsive Sadistic Hinderance).

Bureacracies
1. Size: Small office (3-6 workers). Shape: Square (ho-hum). Problem: Very crowded. Hundreds of citizens are waiting in line, queued up and p’d off. Security clearances vary from INFRARED to GREEN. The line moves slowly. Citizens near the front look as if they haven’t eaten for days. Clearance of Workers: ORANGE and YELLOW with one GREEN administrator visiting. Waiting Time: 10 minutes.
2. Size: Cell or refitted closet. Shape: Pentacular. Problem: Too many desks. Way too many desks. Desks piled on top of each other. Clearance of Workers: INFRARED. Waiting Time: Medium line of citizens, one hour.
3. Size: Normal office (7-30 workers). Shape: Pentacular. Problem: Thermostat’s broken. Temperature varies from absolute zero to the boiling point of lead. Clearance of Workers: RED. Waiting Time: Long line, two hours.

Excuses (Information)
1. If the NPC told the inquirer, the NPC would have to kill him. If the inquirer insists, do it and fine him 100 credits. The next clone doesn’t remember the answer, so you don’t need an actual answer.
2. Imply the question is a sign of unhappiness.
3. The form to request that information is currently being revised.

Equipment Denial
1. ‘That item has been sent to our labs for testing due to apparent design flaws. We may still have some in stock, though, if you want me to go check...’
2. ‘Yes, of course, one moment while I get it for you.’ [Wanders off and doesn’t come back.]
3. ‘According to [your briefing officer/my supervisor/The Computer], that equipment is not necessary for your mission.’

Clerks
1. Rookie Clerk: Rookie. Untrained, clueless and vulnerable; a lone gazelle in the middle of the Serengeti.
2. Doughnut Lover: Fat, slow, amusing. May also have a keen mind beneath the blubber.
3. Cheerful and competent: Likes his job. Smiles and answers all questions in a clear and concise manner. If he can’t help the Troubleshooters, he knows precisely where they should go and to whom they should talk. This should completely unnerve them.

Clues
1. A trail of blood.
2. A witness cooperates with the PCs but only really can provide directions on where the PCs should go next.
3. A note discussing future plans in a vague manner (possibly directing PCs to the next scenes).

Evidence
1. A seditious complaint form complaining about botulism in the cafeteria. Doubting the perfection of The Computer’s food preparation and handling staff is treason.
2. Someone scratched *‘down with The Computer’* into the side of this desk.
3. A ticket to a FunBall game. Statistically, certain proof that the suspect was associating with a traitor.
