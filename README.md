## Paranoia_Super_Mission_Generator

1. ```git clone``` the repo.

2. ```bundle install```

3. ```ruby main.rb```

You will receive a prompt to "name" your mission. That name will serve as a seed that will be used to generate the mission in question (which will be formatted using Markdown). You can reuse the same seed to get the same mission. (If you don't actually care about replicating the same mission again, you can just randomly smash on the keyboard.)

Look at EXAMPLE.md to see how an example generated mission might look like. I recommend generating multiple missions and picking and choosing what elements you want (customizing it to match your own purposes). Secret society missions are pretty generic and will probably require some major customizations (or even to be re-written from scratch) to match the mood and style of your mission.

## Credits
In addition to writing out my own material, I used the following supplements from the PARANOIA XP line:

 - The Paranoia XP GM's Screen, specifically the Mission Blender (almost all of it)
 - The Traitor's Manual, specifically the "Illuminati Motivation Table of Doom" (provides additional motivation to the NPCs as well as complications to the mission)
 - Criminal Histories (the different "job types" in Alpha Complex)
 - Internal Security (additional missions and locations)

The name generator uses names from an example [email generator built using Calyx](https://github.com/maetl/calyx/blob/master/examples/faker.rb), and the generator itself was inspired by the [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) Ruby gem.

The personality generator came from the [Cyberpunk City Generator](http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=jDryXCLa), which uses traits from [Hearts of Iron 2](http://www.paradoxian.org/hoi2wiki/index.php/Minister_Traits) and ["Blood, Words, and Money: Organizations and Factions"](http://lotbieth.blogspot.com/2014/02/blood-words-and-money-organizations-and.html).

The fake word generator (which I used to come up with random names to objects, including R&D devices) came from anticoders' [fake-words](https://github.com/anticoders/fake-words/blob/master/index.js).

## Dev Notes

This program is my take on the famous "Mission Blender". There is already [an online version of the Mission Blender](http://www.highprogrammer.com/cgi-bin/mission_blender) when I started work on this project, but that project required me to "think" how to merge all the randomly-generated items together. What I wanted is a system that automates as much of the mission-generation process possible. Some human effort is still needed at the end of the day (because the goal of a tabletop RPG session is to entertain humans, not bots), but will be used more efficently - curating and refining the generated output.

The format of the generated mission is usually self-explanatory, but I like to explain two things.

### Background
The "background" at the start of the mission is based off the format in most professionally published PARANOIA missions, where the GM is given some details about the covert dealings that is responsible for the current mission. The PCs may (or may not) be able to discover what's going on (and it's possible the PCs may not even care). But there is usually a reason behind the madness (which tends to help the GM improvise even more madness on-the-fly).

The "Mission Blender" attempted to approximate this "background" material by starting off with the slogan "**PARANOIA** is the **IRRATIONAL** **FEAR** that **SOMEONE is OUT TO GET YOU**", and having you roll on charts to find out certain mission elements that can be associated with the highlighted words. While nice in theory, it felt flat in practice since there was not really much connection between those elements and the main mission itself (requiring me to think hard...and thinking is actually pretty hard).

So instead, for my generator, I created my own "background" template, based off a sterotypical power struggle between a low-clearance "underdog" fighting against a high-clearance citizen (the "overdog"). The rest of the generated mission would refer to this power struggle, providing an overall sort of "unity" to the scheme.

The content in the Mission Blender's approximation tables would wind up being reused in other places (for example, as possible generated missions for the player to be on...or as "complications" for the players to encounter).

### Complications

The "complications" section is my attempt to implement Step 2 of ["The Adventure Funnel"](http://xbowvsbuddha.blogspot.com/2006/10/adventure-funnel.html) (a manual approach to generating tabletop RPG adventures). Step 2 requires the GM to generate obstacles that stands in the way of the PCs' goals (after all, without any obstacles, the PCs' job would be easy and we wouldn't have much of a game). I chose the name "complications" rather than "obstacles" (since the supplements **Internal Security** and **High Programmer** uses the term when describing how to generate missions), but they mean pretty much the same thing.

Many PARANOIA missions tend to have certain weird scenes, events, and even whole missions that are almost loosely connected to the main plotline, serving as complications for the PCs to overcome (or at least run away from). So it's almost paramount that I include "complications" into my mission generation (regardless of the name I assigned to it).

The vanilla mission blender does not really reflect "complications" except in its approximation of generating "background" material above. What I did is to create a huge table containing possible complications the PCs may face while doing their mission, and then randomly pick possible complications.

The Mission Blender does a good job with Step 1 (as it already generates a goal for PCs to fight for), and with enough generated details, it's usually very eas for GM to manually perform Step 3 (adding details to the generated goal and complications) on their own.
